# Pursuit-Core-Web-FullStack-User-Authentication-Lab

Pick one of your past Full-Stack projects, fork it if you haven't already and add user authentication to the Back-end and Front-End.

Alternatively grab the backed `Todos-Backend` included in this repo and add proper Back-end user authentication with Passport. You might need to modify the database schema a bit. Make sure no todos can be retrieved from the back-end if the user is not logged in.

Build Front-End to access the Back-end with proper user authentication. You can use the `Frontend` folder in this repo to start off.

Adding user authentication is probably going to be different for everyone but the core will be the same. You might need to create a users table or add a column for the password etc.
