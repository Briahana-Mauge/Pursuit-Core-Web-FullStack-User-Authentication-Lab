# Pursuit-Core-Web-Backend-Authentication-Lab

Pick one of your old Full-Stack projects or Back-End lab and add user authentication to it.
In the chosen project just create a new branch called `with-user-authentication`. Make your changes to setup user authentication for your backend and make sure you test it with Postman.

Adding user authentication is probably going to be different for everyone but the core will be the same. You might need to create a users table or add a column for the password etc.
